 `ExclusivityController` is a singleton to keep track of all the in-flight
 `Operation` instances that have declared themselves as requiring mutual exclusivity.
 We use a singleton because mutual exclusivity must be enforced across the entire
 app, regardless of the `OperationQueue` on which an `Operation` was executed.
