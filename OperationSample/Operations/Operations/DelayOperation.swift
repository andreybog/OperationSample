Abstract:
This file shows how to make an operation that efficiently waits.
*/

import Foundation

/**
 `DelayOperation` is an `Operation` that will simply wait for a given time
 interval, or until a specific `NSDate`.
 
 It is important to note that this operation does **not** use the `sleep()`
 function, since that is inefficient and blocks the thread on which it is called.
 Instead, this operation uses `dispatch_after` to know when the appropriate amount
 of time has passed.
 
 If the interval is negative, or the `NSDate` is in the past, then this operation
 immediately finishes.
